#Talatat
####A generalized app with no special utilitiy or purpose except for me to test out various building blocks and emerging technologies; built on Pyramid.


###ABOUT TALATAT

Name for small blocks of sandstone used to construct Akhenaten's Aten temples and palaces in ancient Egypt. Due to their handy and uniform size, they expedited building things and structures that used them were often later dismantled and the blocks were reused in other constructions. The origin of the term talatat is supposedly originates with the Arabic word for "three", insomuch as the dimension of a talatat was three palm-widths.

###TECHNOLOGY STACK
Stradivarius is built on Pyramid (a Python framework) installed on an AWS EC2 server (Linux Ubuntu 14.04 LTS) associated with an Elastic IP. Site styling is provided courtesy of Bootstrap.  All HTML5/CSS3 is fully validated. 

###SETTINGS
Talatat's settings are managed via environment variables and the development or production .ini files as suggested by the [official documentation] (http://docs.pylonsproject.org/projects/pyramid/en/latest/narr/environment.html#environment-chapter).
